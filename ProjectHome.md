JHashPassword isn’t just another password-generator. With this tool you’re able to generate safe passwords for online-banking, mailing, online-shopping, … without the need of remember all the passwords. You only have to remember one passphrase you’re free to choose. JHashPassword generates based on this passphrase and the host and login settings unique passwords. You set how the passwords should look like (length, charset,…) and JHashPassword does the rest. All settings are saved in an xml-file and you can exchange this file between the supported platforms (Android, Linux, Windows). The passwords aren’t saved, so that it is not possible to decrypt them by spying on your settings.
